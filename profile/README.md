## Flow-MER
Flow-MER is the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder's Flow Monitoring Evaluation and Research (Flow-MER) program

This is a place for Flow_MER team members to share some of our analysis code and help each other.  Python, R, PowerBI, SQL.. whatever the flavour.

You don't need to be an expert programmer to contribute.  GitHub can be confusing but others can help with advice or put your code up for you.

Reach out to the Basin-scale data mangement team if you need help or drop a note in the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Flow-MER/discussions)
